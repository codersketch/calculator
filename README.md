#How It Works
#Form Submission:

Users input two numbers and select an operator (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
The form uses POST method to submit the data to the same PHP file.
PHP Processing:

The PHP script captures the form data and sanitizes it.
It checks for errors such as empty fields, non-numeric input, and division by zero.
Based on the selected operator, it performs the calculation and displays the result.
Result Display:

If the calculation is successful, the result is displayed on the web page.
If there are errors, appropriate error messages are shown.
Example Usage
Enter the first value.
Select an operator (e.g., + for addition).
Enter the second value.
Click the "Submit" button.
View the result or any error messages displayed on the page.
